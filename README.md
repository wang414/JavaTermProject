## 1.Introduction
### Plants vs. Zombies
A replica of classical tower defense video game PLANTs VS ZOMBIES developed and published by PopCap Games.  

### Implementation methods
We reproduced some levels of adventure game mode by using java.Swing and java.Awt.  
Briefly, we use Jbutton as the container of every plant, zombie, bullet, etc.  
To let them animated, we choose gif as the Image, but not pngs changed at every frame.
